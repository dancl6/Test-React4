        Company provides energy generation equipment. 
        Thoroughly reviewed ASME BPVC Section VIII code for the 2019 version determining whether any designs were impacted. 
        Built a computational model in Fluent, solving for the temperature and flow of fluid (thermal fluid model) for a military application. Used Ansys Workbench to solve for the temperature and structural stress (thermal mechanical model), looking at CTE mismatch for a space vehicle application. Where possible, validated simulations with hand calculations for Heat Transfer and Stress Analysis.
